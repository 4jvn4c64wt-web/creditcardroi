# Credit Card Value Tracker — Development Guide

Last updated: May 26, 2026 (added 5 Bank of America card modules)

This document is the single source of context for anyone (human or AI) making changes to the Credit Card Value Tracker codebase. Read the relevant section before touching any code.

## Maintaining This Document

**Rule: If you changed _how_ something works or _where_ something lives, update this guide before the work is considered done. If you followed an existing pattern without changing the pattern itself, no update needed.**

### Update the guide when you:

- Add a new card definition file (update the card table in Section 3)
- Add or rename a file (update the File Map in Section 3)
- Add a new function that other code will need to call (update the Function Index in the Appendix)
- Add a new state field (update the State Management table in Section 9)
- Change the data flow or processing pipeline (update Section 4)
- Add special-case logic in a card's `getMultiplier()` hook for a new card (update Section 6)
- Introduce a new pattern that will be repeated in the future (add a Playbook in Section 14)
- Add or remove an analytics event (update the event inventory in Section 19.4 in the same edit)
- Change how an existing system works (update the relevant section)

### Don't bother updating for:

- Adding merchants to `merchants.js`
- Adding keyword patterns to `classification.js`
- Changing multiplier values or credit amounts in an existing card definition
- Updating CFF quarterly bonus data
- Bug fixes that don't change architecture
- UI tweaks that don't add new sections or functions

### How to update

Edit this file directly. Update the "Last updated" date at the top. Keep entries concise — this is a reference, not a changelog.

## 1. Product Overview

The Credit Card Value Tracker answers one question: **is each credit card worth its annual fee?**

Users upload CSV transaction exports. The app classifies each transaction, applies the correct card-specific point multiplier, detects statement credits, and produces a net value calculation:

```
Net Value = (points earned × point value) + statement credits used − annual fee
```

Everything runs locally in the browser. Transaction data never leaves the user's machine. The app uses localStorage for persistence.

**Audience:** Credit card optimizers and churners making annual fee renewal decisions. This is a retrospective analysis tool, not a daily spending optimizer.

**Freemium tiers:**
- **Free** (`app.html` → `app.js`): Read-only analysis, 12 months of data
- **Decision Pass** ($12): Unlocks editing for one card for 7 days (currently greyed out / "Coming Soon")
- **Pro** (`app-pro.html` → `app-pro.js`): Full editing, 6 years of data, What-If scenarios ($14/year suggested, pay what you think is fair)

---

## 2. Architecture

### High-Level Structure

```
Browser loads HTML page
  → loads card definition scripts (cards/*.js)
  → loads merchants.js, classification.js, csv-parser.js
  → loads app-core.js (all shared business logic + UI)
  → loads tier wrapper (app.js OR app-pro.js)
  → loads tutorial.js
  → tier wrapper calls initCore()
```

All business logic and UI rendering live in `app-core.js`. The tier wrappers (`app.js` and `app-pro.js`) are thin — they set `window.TIER_CONFIG` and add tier-specific event handlers (newsletter popup, upgrade modals for free; license validation for pro). Both call `initCore()` on DOMContentLoaded.

### Module System

There is no bundler. Scripts register onto `window.CardTracker` namespace and are loaded via `<script>` tags in HTML. Constants are aliased to local names at the top of `app-core.js` for convenience:

```
window.CardTracker.cards          → const CARDS
window.CardTracker.merchants      → const KNOWN_MERCHANTS
window.CardTracker.monarchMap     → const MONARCH_MAP
window.CardTracker.classification → CATEGORY_HIERARCHY, CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENTS, etc.
window.CardTracker.csvParser      → detectCSVFormat, showColumnMapping, parseCSV, etc.
window.CardTracker.cffQuarterlyData → CFF quarterly bonus history
```

### No Network Calls (with one exception)

The core application makes zero network requests for its primary functionality. Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts. Analytics (Cloudflare Web Analytics) are passive. There is no API, no backend, no LLM calls during normal operation.

**Exception — Gumroad license verification:** `app.js` makes one POST to `https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify` at Pro activation. `app-pro.js` makes the same call at most once every 7 days for re-verification (when `lastVerified` is more than 7 days old). This is the only network call made by the application logic. Both pages include `connect-src https://api.gumroad.com` in their Content Security Policy.

## 4. Data Flow

### Upload → Results Pipeline

```
1. User uploads CSV file
   ↓
2. csv-parser.js: detectCSVFormat() auto-detects columns
   ↓
3. User confirms/adjusts column mapping (showColumnMapping)
   ↓
4. csv-parser.js: parseCSV() extracts raw transactions
   Each raw txn = { id, date, merchant, amount, last4, account, monarchCategory, original }
   ↓
5. Raw transactions merged with savedTransactions (deduplication via content-based IDs)
   ↓
6. User maps last-4 digits → card IDs (showMapping)
   ↓
7. processTransactions() — THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
   For each transaction:
   a. Skip detection (payments, transfers, fees — with annual fee extraction)
   b. Check confirmed transactions (user overrides)
   c. classifyMerchant() → { subcategory, confidence, source, reason }
   d. Sibling transaction boost (post-processing confidence)
   e. mapToCardCategory() → maps subcategory to card's earning categories via hierarchy
   f. getMultiplier() → { rate, reason } with full date/card-specific logic
   g. detectCredit() for positive-amount transactions
   h. Calculate points = amount × multiplier × pointValue
   ↓
8. Summary aggregation: group by card → spend, points, credits, annual fee, net value
   ↓
9. renderView() displays results (summary, all transactions, card scenarios)
```

### Key Principle: processTransactions() Is the Only Calculator

All views (summary, transactions, card scenarios) derive from the same `processTransactions()` output. There are no parallel calculation paths. If the number is wrong, the bug is in processTransactions() or the functions it calls.

---

## 5. Classification System

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 1: Subcategory Detection
  classifyMerchant() → "coffee-shop", "drugstore", "flights-direct", etc.
  
Layer 2: Category Hierarchy Rollup
  mapToCardCategory() walks CATEGORY_HIERARCHY to find what the card actually earns on
  Example: "coffee-shop" → "dining" (because card has dining bonus but not coffee-shop)

Layer 3: Card-Specific Multiplier
  getMultiplier() applies the rate for the resolved category
  Example: dining on CSR → 3x (legacy) or per current rates
```

### Priority Order (in classifyMerchant)

1. **Skip patterns** — payments, transfers, statement balance lines (always filter first)
2. **User-defined merchant rules** — `state.merchantRules[cacheKey]` (user chose this)
3. **Known merchant list** — `KNOWN_MERCHANTS` in merchants.js (hardcoded high-confidence)
4. **Multi-signal heuristics** — CSV category + keyword matching + POS patterns + address patterns
5. **Fallback** — `other` with confidence 0

### Confidence Scoring

Additive system. Each signal adds or subtracts points:

| Signal | Base (CSV present) | Discovery (CSV vague) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| CSV category maps cleanly | +50 (base) | — |
| Known merchant list | 100 (override) | 100 (override) |
| Keyword match agrees | +10 | +25 |
| POS pattern agrees | +15 | +25 |
| Address pattern agrees | +10 | +25 |
| 2+ heuristics agree | +10 bonus | +10 bonus |
| Signal conflicts | −10 to −15 | — |
| Sibling transactions | +15 each (max +50) | +15 each (max +50) |

**Threshold: 50.** Below this, the transaction is flagged "Needs Review."

### Category Hierarchy (CATEGORY_HIERARCHY)

Defined in `classification.js`. Maps child → parent. Walk upward to find the card's earning category.

```
coffee-shop → dining → null (top-level)
uber-ride → transit → null
hotels-direct → travel → null
cell-phone → utilities → null (but cell-phone is its own earning category on some cards)
```

**Important:** `lyft` is top-level (not under transit) because Chase has a specific Lyft partnership bonus.

### Where to Find Things

| What | File | Search |
|------|------|--------|
| Category hierarchy | classification.js | `CATEGORY_HIERARCHY` |
| Known merchants | merchants.js | `window.CardTracker.merchants` |
| Keyword patterns | classification.js | `SPECIFIC_CATEGORY_KEYWORDS` |
| Keyword exclusions | classification.js | `KEYWORD_EXCLUSIONS` |
| Travel classification | classification.js | `classifyTravel` |
| Online grocery detection | classification.js | `ONLINE_GROCERY_PATTERNS` |
| Main classifier | classification.js | `classifyMerchant` |
| CSV-to-subcategory map | classification.js | `CSV_TO_SUBCATEGORY` |
| Monarch category map | merchants.js | `monarchMap` |
| Confidence thresholds | classification.js | `CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENTS` |

## 6. Points Calculation

### The One Function: getMultiplier()

`getMultiplier(cardId, category, txnDate, merchantDesc)` → `{ rate, reason }`

This is the single source of truth for "how many points does this card earn on this category." Every view calls it. The `reason` string is the audit trail.

**Location:** `app-core.js` ~line 977

### How Card-Specific Logic Is Handled

All card-specific multiplier logic lives in each card's own `getMultiplier` plugin hook (defined in `cards/<card-id>.js`). The `getMultiplier()` function in `app-core.js` calls the hook first and only falls through to generic logic if the hook returns `null`.

This means **you do not add card-specific logic to `app-core.js`**. You add it to the card file.

Cards currently using `getMultiplier` hooks:
- **CSR** — Lyft partnership (date-dependent 10x → 5x), legacy rates (pre Oct 26, 2025)
- **CFF** — Quarterly rotating categories, PayPal December-only handling, merchant-keyword bonuses
- **Cash+** — User-selected 5% and 2% quarterly categories
- **Bilt cards** — Legacy vs 2.0 (Feb 7, 2026 cutoff), rent ratio tiers, Bilt Cash mode (via `bilt-plugin.js`)
- **Capital One Venture X** — Portal sub-types (10x hotels/rental cars, 5x flights/other)
- **Amex Platinum** — Portal sub-types (5x hotels/flights, 1x car rentals/other)

The generic fallback (after all hooks decline) handles:
- **Streaming keyword validation** — Cards with `streamingKeywords` only give the bonus for approved services
- **Standard hierarchy walk** — `getEffectiveCategory()` finds the card's best matching category

**Bilt Cash note:** Bilt Cash (4%) is a flat rebate on ALL non-rent spend on any Bilt card. It is completely independent of points/multipliers — do not mix or combine them. See Section 13 for how Bilt Cash is handled in scenarios. The 4% rate is defined as `BILT_CASH_RATE` in `bilt-plugin.js`.

### Annual Fee Calculation

`getEffectiveAnnualFee(cardId, transactions)` handles:
- Cards with `annualFeeStartDate` (no fee before that date)
- Cards with `legacyCutoffDate` and `legacyAnnualFee`
- Auto-detected fees from transaction data (`state.detectedAnnualFees`)
- User-overridden fees in card config

---

## 7. Credit Detection & Tracking

### Credit Types

**Auto-detected credits** match against `keywords` in the card's `credits` array. Positive-amount transactions are scanned by `detectCredit()`.

**Manual credits** require the user to check off months in the card config. They appear in the `monthlyCredits` state.

**Custom sub-UI credits** (e.g., streaming selector) have dedicated UI sections in `renderCardConfig()` and their own state keys.

### Credit Implementation Checklist

For **simple credits** (auto-detected or manual): just add the entry to the card's `credits` array in `cards/<card-id>.js`. Everything else is dynamic.

For **credits with custom UI** (like the streaming selector): follow the full checklist in the [Credit Implementation Guide](#credit-implementation-guide-integration) section below.

---

## 8. Card Definitions

Each card file registers into `window.CardTracker.cards` (or `window.CardTracker.cardsList` which auto-registers). A card definition includes:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Chase Sapphire Reserve',        // Full display name
  shortName: 'CSR',                       // Abbreviated name for tables
  annualFee: 795,                         // Current annual fee
  pointValue: 0.018,                      // Default cents per point
  baseRate: 1,                            // Multiplier for uncategorized spend
  categories: ['chase-travel', 'dining', 'flights-direct', 'hotels-direct', 'lyft', ...],
  multipliers: { 'chase-travel': 8, 'flights-direct': 4, 'hotels-direct': 4, 'dining': 3, 'lyft': 5 },
  credits: [
    { name: 'Travel Credit', amount: 300, keywords: ['TRAVEL CREDIT'], manual: false },
    { name: 'Lyft Credit', amount: 120, keywords: [], manual: true }
  ],

  // Optional: legacy support
  legacyCutoffDate: '2025-10-26',
  legacyAnnualFee: 550,
  legacy: { categories: [...], multipliers: {...} },

  // Optional: special flags
  isBilt: true,                           // Enables Bilt-specific logic in app-core.js Card Scenarios
  annualFeeStartDate: '2026-02-07',       // Fee didn't exist before this date
  lyftPartnershipStart: '2020-01-12',     // Chase Lyft partnership start

  // Optional: streaming validation
  streamingKeywords: ['netflix', 'spotify', 'hulu', ...],

  // Optional: annual bonus points
  annualBonusPoints: 10000,               // Points awarded on card anniversary

  // ── Plugin hooks (all optional) ─────────────────────────────────────────────

  // Called by getMultiplier() in app-core.js. Return { rate, reason } or null to fall through.
  getMultiplier: function(category, txnDate, merchantDesc, ctx) { ... },

  // Called by getCardCategories() in app-core.js. Return array of valid category strings or null.
  getCategories: function(txnDate, ctx) { ... },

  getDisplayRate: function(category, txnDate, ctx) { ... },

  // Called by the recategorization modal to limit which categories appear in the dropdown.
  // Return an array of allowed category strings, or null to show all categories.
  // Used by CFF (show only active quarterly bonus categories) and Cash+ (show only selected categories).
  getCategoryFilter: function(txnDate, currentCategory, ctx) { ... },

  // Plugin-managed state fields. Declares which localStorage keys this card needs.
  // app-core.js initializes these automatically on startup — do not add them to the state object.
  pluginState: {
    stateFields: [
      { key: 'myCardConfig', storageKey: 'ccTracker_myCardConfig', defaultValue: {} }
    ],
    exportState: function(ctx) { ... },
    importState: function(data, ctx) { ... },
    clearState: function(ctx) { ... },
  },
}
```

### Bilt Three-Layer Architecture

The three Bilt cards (Blue, Obsidian, Palladium) use a shared plugin to avoid duplicating their complex program logic. The layers are:

**Layer 1 — Card identity files** (`bilt-blue.js`, `bilt-obsidian.js`, `bilt-palladium.js`): Hold what differs per card — name, fee, multiplier rates, credits, categories. Each file delegates all plugin hooks to the shared plugin:
```js
getMultiplier: function(category, txnDate, merchantDesc, ctx) {
  this._pluginCardId = 'bilt-blue'; // tells the plugin which card is calling
  return biltPlugin.getMultiplier.call(this, category, txnDate, merchantDesc, ctx);
},
```

**Layer 2 — Shared Bilt logic module** (`bilt-plugin.js`): Holds everything shared across the program: the 2.0 start date, Bilt Cash rate, rent tier thresholds, calculation engine, config UI, scenario routing hooks. All Bilt program constants are defined here as named properties (`BILT_2_START`, `BILT_CASH_RATE`, `RENT_POINTS_FLOOR`, `RENT_TIERS`). **Update these constants here when Bilt changes program terms — do not hardcode values elsewhere.**

**Layer 3 — App core** (`app-core.js`): Holds the generic calculation pipeline and the Bilt-aware Card Scenarios engine (rent routing, Bilt Cash gating). The scenarios engine intentionally stays in app-core.js because the logic pattern is permanent even if Bilt's numbers change.

All three Bilt card files share the same `pluginState` and `scenarioPrompt` objects by reference. When adding a new hook to `bilt-plugin.js`, **always wire it up in all three card files**.

### Adding a New Card

1. Create `cards/<card-id>.js` with full definition
2. Add a `<script src="cards/<card-id>.js"></script>` tag in both `app.html` and `app-pro.html` (before `app-core.js`)
3. If the card has special earning logic (quarterly categories, date-dependent rates, partner bonuses), implement a `getMultiplier` hook **in the card file** — do not add logic to `app-core.js`
4. If the card has date-dependent categories, implement a `getCategories` hook in the card file
5. If the card has special annual fee logic, implement a `getAnnualFee` hook in the card file
6. If the card needs custom rate display in the recategorization modal, implement a `getDisplayRate` hook
7. If the card needs to limit which categories appear in the recategorization modal, implement a `getCategoryFilter` hook
8. If the card needs custom persistent state, declare `pluginState.stateFields` — do not add fields to the state object in `app-core.js`
9. If the card has a legacy earning structure, add a `legacy` object with `categories` and `multipliers`, and use `legacyCutoffDate` for the transition date
10. Add card name to `index.html` supported cards section
11. Test: upload a CSV, map the card, verify multipliers on known merchants

### Changing Earning Rates

For simple rate changes, just update the `multipliers` object in the card definition file. The rest is automatic.

For **date-dependent rate changes** (like CSR's Oct 2025 transition), you need:
- A cutoff date field on the card definition
- A `getMultiplier` hook in the card file that checks the transaction date and returns legacy rates when appropriate
- A `getCategories` hook if the category list also changes by date
- A `getAnnualFee` hook (or `legacyAnnualFee` field) if the fee also changed
- A `legacy` object in the card definition with the old rates

---

## 9. State Management

All app state lives in the `state` object (defined ~line 237 of `app-core.js`). State splits into two types:

### Persistent State (survives page reload)

Stored in localStorage with `ccTracker_` prefix. Loaded on page init with `safeLocalStorageGet()`.

| State Key | localStorage Key | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `cardMappings` | `ccTracker_cardMappings` | last4 → cardId mapping |
| `merchantCache` | `ccTracker_merchantCache` | Classification cache |
| `customPointValues` | `ccTracker_pointValues` | User-adjusted point valuations |
| `creditOverrides` | `ccTracker_creditOverrides` | Manual credit/refund assignments |
| `disabledCredits` | `ccTracker_disabledCredits` | Credits user turned off |
| `monthlyCredits` | `ccTracker_monthlyCredits` | Manual credit month claims |
| `streamingCredits` | `ccTracker_streamingCredits` | Paramount/Peacock monthly selections |
| `merchantRules` | `ccTracker_merchantRules` | User-created merchant → category rules |
| `confirmedTransactions` | `ccTracker_confirmedTxns` | Single-transaction category confirmations |
| `cashPlusCategories` | `ccTracker_cashPlusCategories` | Cash+ quarterly 5%/2% selections _(plugin-initialized by Cash+ card)_ |
| `cffCategories` | `ccTracker_cffCategories` | CFF quarterly data (legacy) _(plugin-initialized by CFF card)_ |
| `cffPaypalDecemberOnly` | `ccTracker_cffPaypalDecemberOnly` | CFF PayPal December flag by year _(plugin-initialized by CFF card)_ |
| `biltConfig` | `ccTracker_biltConfig` | Bilt-specific settings per card _(plugin-initialized by bilt-plugin.js)_ |
| `customAnnualBonusPoints` | `ccTracker_annualBonusPoints` | User-adjusted anniversary bonus |
| `cardYearToggles` | `ccTracker_cardYearToggles` | Which cards show card year view |
| `columnMappings` | `ccTracker_columnMappings` | Remembered CSV column mappings by shape |
| `savedTransactions` | `ccTracker_transactions` | All raw transactions |
| `decisionPasses` | `ccTracker_decisionPasses` | Active Decision Pass keys |
| `proAccess` | `ccTracker_proAccess` | Pro license: `{ key, lastVerified }`. `lastVerified` is rolling — updates on every successful Gumroad API response. Subscription validity is controlled entirely by Gumroad membership; if the membership lapses, the weekly re-verification will return `success: false` and access stops. Excluded from clear/reset. Included in export/import: `lastVerified` carried over as-is so the 7-day re-verification window transfers correctly. |
| `dpBannersDismissed` | `ccTracker_dpBannersDismissed` | Dismissed upgrade banners |
| `featureEducation` | `ccTracker_featureEducation` | Tracks which feature tutorials have been shown |
| (infrastructure) | `ccTracker_dataVersion` | Data schema version (integer) — managed by migration system, not in `state` object |

### Session State (reset on reload)

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `transactions` | Working copy of raw transactions |
| `results` | Output of processTransactions() |
| `detectedAnnualFees` | Fees found in transaction data |
| `activeView` | Current tab (summary/transactions/cardscenarios) |
| `selectedYear` | Year filter |
| `cardScenarios` | What-If wizard state |

### When Adding New State

**For card-specific state** (state that only one card or plugin needs): declare it in `pluginState.stateFields` in the card file rather than hardcoding it in app-core.js. The app will initialize it automatically. You still need to update export/import/clear — use the `pluginState.exportState`, `importState`, and `clearState` hooks.

**For general app state**, you must update **all** of these locations (search terms in parentheses):

1. **State initialization** — `let state = {` (~line 237)
2. **Save logic** — wherever the state is modified, add `safeLocalStorageSet()`
3. **Export JSON** — search `version: '1.1'`
4. **Import validation** — search `Validate object types for settings`
5. **Import restore** — search `backup.monthlyCredits` (nearby)
6. **Clear settings** — search `Clear all settings button`
7. **Delete all data** — search `Type DELETE to confirm`
8. **Data migration** (if changing structure of existing data) — increment `DATA_VERSION`, add migration function to `DATA_MIGRATIONS` array

### Data Versioning & Migrations

The app uses a versioned migration system for localStorage data. On every page load, `runDataMigrations()` runs before state initialization, comparing the stored `ccTracker_dataVersion` against the code's `DATA_VERSION` constant and running any needed migration functions.

| Constant/Key | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `DATA_VERSION` | Current data schema version (integer, in code) |
| `ccTracker_dataVersion` | Stored data version (integer, in localStorage) |
| `DATA_MIGRATIONS` | Array of migration functions (index N = v(N) → v(N+1)) |
| `runDataMigrations()` | Runner that executes pending migrations sequentially |

**When to add a migration:** Whenever you change the *structure* of existing persisted data (rename a field, change a value's type, add a required sub-field to existing objects). You do NOT need a migration for adding a brand-new localStorage key with a new default — `safeLocalStorageGet()` handles that.

**How to add a migration:**
1. Increment `DATA_VERSION` by 1
2. Add a new function at the end of `DATA_MIGRATIONS`
3. The function reads from localStorage, transforms, and writes back
4. If the migration touches keys that are re-read during import, add a re-read line in the import migration block (search `Re-read migrated data into state`)

## 10. Tier System

### How Tiers Work

`window.TIER_CONFIG` is set by the tier wrapper before `initCore()` runs. Values: `'free'` or `'pro'`.

Decision Passes are per-card temporary upgrades stored in `state.decisionPasses`. They last 7 days.

### Pro Validation

On every load of `app-pro.html`, `app-pro.js` runs a re-verification check before calling `initCore()`:

**Re-verification (`lastVerified`)** — Controls how often the app phones home to Gumroad. If `lastVerified` is more than 7 days ago, the app calls `verifyGumroadLicense()`. On success, `lastVerified` updates to now and the app proceeds. On failure (API returns `success: false` or network error), a non-dismissable "Verification Required" modal appears with an OK button that redirects to `app.html`. If `lastVerified` is within 7 days, no API call is made.

Subscription validity is controlled entirely by Gumroad — if the membership lapses, the weekly re-verification will return `success: false` and access stops. There is no local expiry check.

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `isCardEditable(cardId, editType)` | Can user edit this card's settings? |
| `hasActiveDecisionPass(cardId)` | Does this card have an active DP? |
| `applyTierDateFiltering(transactions)` | Limit data window by tier |
| `pruneTransactionsForStorage(transactions)` | Trim old data before saving |
| `isNeedsReviewVisible(t, dpLookup)` | Should low-confidence flag show? |
| `verifyGumroadLicense(key)` | POST to Gumroad API, returns `{ success }` |
| `proNeedsReverification()` | Is `lastVerified` more than 7 days old? |
| `updateProLastVerified()` | Update `lastVerified` to now |
| `hasValidProAccess()` | Does Pro access exist (key present)? |

### Special Cases

- Cash+ quarterly category selection is always editable (even on free tier)
- Bilt config (rent settings, reward options) is always editable except for credits and point values
- Export is gated by tier for most cards
- **Card Scenarios tab** is visible in both free and pro tiers. In the free tier, clicking it shows a pro-gating modal (`#cardScenariosProModal`) instead of rendering the feature. The click is intercepted in `app.js` via `stopImmediatePropagation()` before `initCore()` registers its own tab handler.

---

## 11. CSV Parsing

### Column Auto-Detection

`detectCSVFormat(headers, previewRows)` uses a three-pass approach:
1. Exact phrase match within header text
2. Data format inspection (checks actual cell values for date patterns, amounts, etc.)
3. Word-boundary partial match

### Supported Formats

The parser handles Monarch Money, Chase, Amex, Wells Fargo (headerless), and generic CSVs. Format detection is based on column names and data patterns, not bank identification.

### Column Mapping UI

Users always confirm the auto-detected mapping before processing. Previous mappings are remembered by CSV "shape" (sorted header hash) in `state.columnMappings`.

### Key Fields Extracted

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| date | Yes | Transaction date |
| merchant/description | Yes | Primary classification input |
| amount | Yes | Dollar amount |
| account/card number | Yes | Last-4 extraction for card mapping |
| category | No | CSV-provided category (used as classification signal) |
| original statement | No | Secondary classification input (often more detailed) |
| account name | No | Display hint during card mapping |

---

## 12. UI Rendering

### Page Structure

The app has several sections that show/hide:
- `uploadSection` — Initial CSV upload zone
- `columnMappingSection` — Column confirmation step
- `mappingSection` — Card number → card mapping
- `resultsSection` — Main results view with a shell topbar, details strip, and tab navigation
- `cardConfigSection` — Per-card configuration editor (not a tab — shown/hidden separately via `showCardConfigEditor()`)

### Shell Tabs

Three tabs in the results view:
- **Summary** (`data-view="summary"`) — Per-card ROI breakdown, credits, net value
- **All Transactions** (`data-view="transactions"`) — Full transaction list with classification details, filters, and drill-down
- **Card Scenarios** (`data-view="cardscenarios"`, `id="cardScenariosTab"`) — What-If wizard (pro-gated in free tier)

### Main Render Functions

| Function | Location (~line) | Purpose |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| `showMapping()` | 2232 | Card number mapping UI |
| `showCardConfigEditor()` | 2281 | Per-card config (point values, credits, quarterly categories, Bilt settings) |
| `renderCardConfig()` | 2419 | Renders card config content (called inside `showCardConfigEditor()`) |
| `showResults()` | 3350 | Sets up results view, year filter, metrics banner |
| `renderCardScenarios()` | 5252 | What-If calculator wizard |
| `renderDetailSection()` | 6391 | Transaction detail drill-down |
| `renderView(view)` | 7122 | Switches between summary/transactions/cardscenarios tabs |
| `showCreditModal()` | 8279 | Reassign credit/refund classification |
| `showCategoryModal()` | 8359 | Recategorize a transaction |

### Badge Colors

Category badges compare across the user's wallet:
- **Green** — Optimal card for this category (or tied)
- **Yellow** — Good, but a better card exists (within 60% of best)
- **Red** — Another card would earn significantly more

Logic is in `getCategoryBadgeStyle()` (~line 1738).

---

## 13. Card Scenarios (What-If)

The Card Scenarios feature is a multi-step wizard in `app-core.js` (~lines 5252–7100). The tab is visible in both free and pro tiers, but free users see a pro-gating modal instead of the wizard (handled in `app.js`).

### Scenario Types
- **Add a card** — "What if I got card X?"
- **Remove a card** — "What if I cancelled card X?"
- **Swap cards** — "What if I replaced card X with card Y?"

### Calculation Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `calculateOptimizationRate()` | Measures how well user currently routes spend |
| `calculateAddCardValue()` | Projects value of adding a new card |
| `calculateRemoveCardValue()` | Projects loss from cancelling a card |
| `calculateSwapValue()` | Net impact of replacing one card with another |
| `calculateCardScenariosNetImpact()` | Final net impact including credits |

### Bilt Cash in Scenarios

Bilt Cash is a **flat 4% rebate on all non-rent spend on any Bilt card**. It is independent of points. In scenarios, a cap-aware routing algorithm (`computeBiltRouting()`) determines which categories to route to Bilt by sorting categories by sacrifice cost and routing cheapest-sacrifice spend first, up to the rent cap.

**Key concepts:**
- **Sacrifice cost**: `altValuePerDollar - biltBaseValuePerDollar` — the points you give up by routing spend to Bilt instead of the alternative card
- **Rent uplift**: `(0.04 / 3) × 100 × biltPointValue` per dollar — the value of rent points you gain from Bilt Cash earned on that dollar (~$0.024/dollar at PV $0.018)
- **Net benefit**: `rentUpliftPerDollar - sacrificeCost` — if positive, routing to Bilt is worthwhile
- **Rent cap**: Monthly rent × $0.03 monthly Bilt Cash needed → annual Bilt spend cap = `monthlyRent × 0.75 × 12`

### Bilt Rewards (Bilt Cash → Rent Points → Remaining)

Bilt Rewards is displayed as a collapsible section in scenario results, separate from points and credits. **Bilt Cash is CONSUMED to earn rent points — do not double-count them.**

#### How Bilt Cash Works

1. **Earned**: 4% of all non-rent spend on any Bilt card
2. **Redeemed**: You must SPEND Bilt Cash to buy rent points ($3 Bilt Cash = 100 Bilt Points, capped at 1 point per $1 rent)
3. **Remaining**: Earned − Redeemed = leftover cash (counted as value only when plan is NOT 'maximize')

**Total Bilt Rewards = Rent Points Value + Bilt Cash Remaining (if plan ≠ maximize)**

#### Rent Points (Bilt 2.0 Flexible Mode)

Under Bilt 2.0 (effective Feb 7, 2026), rent points require redeeming Bilt Cash:
- **$3 of Bilt Cash = 100 rent points** (i.e. $1 Bilt Cash = 33.33 points)
- Rent points are capped at 1 point per $1 rent per month
- `rentUpliftPerDollar = (0.04 / 3) × 100 × biltPointValue` — always computed dynamically, never hardcoded
- At PV $0.018: uplift = ~$0.024/dollar. Break-even PV is $0.03/point.

#### Cap-Aware Routing Algorithm (`computeBiltRouting()`)

Replaces the old `getBiltBenefitPerDollar()` static approach. The algorithm sorts spend categories by sacrifice cost (ascending) and routes to Bilt until the annual spend cap is exhausted. Each plan mode has different behavior:

- `'maximize'`: Full rent uplift in routing. Maximize rent points.
- `'cash'`: No rent uplift in routing. Bilt Cash acts as tiebreaker ONLY for equal-value cards.
- `'custom'`: User specifies monthly Bilt Cash to redeem. Remaining cash IS counted as value.

Each route result includes a `routeReason` string explaining the routing decision.

#### Step 2b Rent & Plan Prompt

The rent/plan prompt (step 2b) appears whenever **any Bilt card is in the current wallet or involved in the scenario**. Controlled by `scenarioInvolvesBilt()`. It collects:
- Monthly rent amount
- Bilt Cash plan (maximize / keep as cash / custom)
- Custom monthly redemption amount (if custom plan)

#### Display

Bilt scenario results look nearly identical to non-Bilt scenarios. The only additions are a rent points row inside Point Value Change and a Bilt Cash line in the top-level summary.

**Top-level summary (Bilt scenarios):**
```
Credits                                +$XX
Point value change (incl. rent pts)    +$XX  ← collapsible flat table + rent points row
Bilt Cash (kept)          [$input]     +$XX  ← editable input, controls rent points
Annual fee                             -$XX
─────────────────────────
Estimated net impact                   +$XX
```

**Non-Bilt scenarios**: Same structure without Bilt Cash line or rent points row.

**Point Value Change section**: Uses the same flat `renderUnifiedSpendTable()` for all scenarios. For Bilt, appends a single "Rent points (N pts @ $X.XXX)" summary row below the table showing the rent points value delta.

**Bilt Cash input**: Editable number input controlling how much Bilt Cash to keep (not redeemed). The remainder is redeemed for rent points. Capped at `[0, finalBiltCashEarned]`. Defaults: maximize plan → $0, cash plan → full earned amount. On blur/enter, updates rent points and all dependent values.

**Key rendering functions:**
- `renderPointValueContent(prefix, rows, baseTotal, biltImpact, tableId, annualizationFactor)` — flat table + optional rent points row
- `updatePointValueContent(prefix, biltImpact)` — live-updates rent points display
- `_updateBiltCashDisplay(prefix, biltImpact)` — updates Bilt Cash input constraints

#### State Properties

- `wi.biltCashPlan` — `'maximize'` | `'cash'` | `'custom'` (default: `'maximize'`)
- `wi.biltCustomMonthlyRedemption` — Monthly $ of Bilt Cash to redeem (for custom plan)
- `wi.biltCashKeptOverride` — User-set Bilt Cash to keep (from the editable input). When set, overrides plan-based computation. Cleared when plan changes.
- `wi.rentAmount` — Monthly rent amount

#### Calculation (in `calculateCardScenariosNetImpact()`)

The return object includes:
- `pointValueChange` — `spendingImpact + rentPointsValueDelta` (Point Value Change line, includes rent points, excludes Bilt Cash)
- `biltCashKeptDelta` — `finalBiltCashRemaining - currentBiltCashRemaining` (Bilt Cash line, separate from points)
- `spendingImpact` — net value change from card-to-card spend shifts only
- `rentPointsValueDelta` — change in annual rent points value
- `totalImpact` — `pointValueChange + creditsImpact + biltCashKeptDelta + feeImpact`
- `finalBiltCashEarned`, `finalBiltCashRedeemed`, `finalBiltCashRemaining`
- `finalRentPointsAnnual`, `finalRentPointsValue`
- `finalBiltSpend`, `currentBiltSpend`
- `currentBiltCashEarned`, `currentBiltCashRedeemed`, `currentBiltCashRemaining`, `currentRentPointsValue`
- `biltCashPlan`, `countCashAsValue`, `monthlyRent`
- `annualBiltSpendCap`, `rentCapUsedPct`

| Scenario | finalBiltSpend | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Remove only Bilt card | 0 | Lose all Bilt Cash + Rent Points |
| Remove Bilt card (another Bilt remains) | Spend routed to remaining Bilt via computeBiltRouting | Partial loss |
| Swap Bilt → Bilt | Routed by computeBiltRouting | Delta based on routing changes |
| Swap Bilt → non-Bilt (no other Bilt) | 0 | Lose all Bilt Cash + Rent Points |
| Swap non-Bilt → Bilt | current + newly routed | Gain Bilt Cash + Rent Points |
| Add Bilt | current + newly routed | Gain Bilt Cash + Rent Points |
| Add non-Bilt (wallet has Bilt) | May decrease if spend shifts away from Bilt | Reduced Bilt Cash |

### Fairness Principle

Both the current and hypothetical wallets must use the same spending assumptions. Applying optimization to only the hypothetical wallet would credit it for fixing existing suboptimal behavior, not just the value of the change itself.

## 14. Playbooks: Common Changes

### A. Adding a New Merchant to the Known List

**File:** `merchants.js`

Add an entry to `window.CardTracker.merchants`:
```javascript
'new merchant name': 'category'
```

The key is matched against normalized (lowercase, alphanumeric-only) merchant descriptions. Use the most specific substring that uniquely identifies the merchant.

**Watch for:** Ordering matters when one key is a substring of another (e.g., `uber eats` must come before `uber`). Test with representative transaction descriptions.

### B. Adding/Changing Earning Rates on an Existing Card

**File:** `cards/<card-id>.js`

Update the `multipliers` object and/or `categories` array. If the rate change is date-dependent:

1. Add a cutoff date field to the card definition
2. Add a `getMultiplier` hook in the card file that returns legacy rates for transactions before the cutoff
3. Add a `getCategories` hook if the category list also changes by date
4. Add a `legacy` object with the old rates if you need to preserve them
5. Test transactions before and after the cutoff date

### C. Adding a Simple Credit

**File:** `cards/<card-id>.js`

Add to the `credits` array:
```javascript
{ name: 'Credit Name', amount: <annual_value>, keywords: ['KEYWORD1', 'KEYWORD2'], manual: false }
```

- `amount` = annual dollar value (e.g., $12.95/mo = 155.40)
- `keywords` = uppercase strings matched against transaction descriptions
- `manual: true` if user must toggle months manually

For simple credits, **that's it**. The UI, ROI calculation, save/load, export/import all work dynamically.

### D. Adding a Credit with Custom Sub-UI

This is the complex case (like the Paramount+/Peacock streaming selector). Follow every step in **both `app.js` AND `app-pro.js`** (if they have parallel UI code) or in `app-core.js` (if shared):

1. Card definition — add credit with custom flag
2. State initialization — add new state field with localStorage persistence
3. Credit UI rendering — add custom sub-section in `renderCardConfig()`
4. Event listeners — add handlers for new interactive elements
5. ROI calculation — update these 5 locations:
   - Summary pre-calc (search: `Pre-calculate totalCredits and netValue`)
   - Credits-used map (search: `Add monthly credits to the map`)
   - Transaction view (search: `Add manual credits - respect year filter`)
   - Card-year manual credits (search: `function getCardYearManualCredits`)
   - Card-year credits-used (search: `function getCardYearCreditsUsed`)
6. Summary credits panel — add line in expanded credits detail
7. Save logic — persist new state to localStorage
8. Export/Import — add to export object, import validation, import restore
9. Clear settings / Delete all — add to both reset paths

### E. Adding a New Card to the App

1. Create `cards/<card-id>.js` with full definition
2. Add `<script>` tag in `app.html` and `app-pro.html` (before `app-core.js`)
3. If the card has special earning logic, implement a `getMultiplier` hook **in the card file** — do not touch `app-core.js`
4. If the card has date-dependent categories, implement a `getCategories` hook in the card file
5. If the card has special annual fee logic, implement a `getAnnualFee` hook in the card file
6. If the card needs custom rate display in the recategorization modal, implement `getDisplayRate`
7. If the card needs to filter the recategorization modal's category list, implement `getCategoryFilter`
8. If the card needs custom persistent state, declare `pluginState.stateFields` in the card file
9. Add card name to `index.html` supported cards section
10. If the card will be featured in an insights article, follow [Playbook H](#18-playbook-h-publishing-a-new-insights-article) and ensure the article's fees/multipliers match the card definition
11. Test: upload a CSV, map the card, verify multipliers on known merchants

### F. Updating CFF Quarterly Bonus Categories

**File:** `cards/chase-freedom-flex-quarters.js`

Add the new quarter's entry to `window.CardTracker.cffQuarterlyData`:
```javascript
'2026-Q2': [
  { key: 'gas', label: 'Gas Stations', rate: 5 },
  { key: 'home-improvement', label: 'Home Improvement', rate: 5 }
]
```

For quarters with merchant-specific bonuses (like McDonald's), use:
```javascript
{ key: 'dining', label: "McDonald's", rate: 5, merchantKeywords: ['mcdonald'] }
```

For PayPal quarters, include `isPaypal: true` and optionally `decemberOnly: true`.

**Important:** `getCardCategories()` dynamically derives CFF's valid categories from `cffQuarterlyData`, so adding new quarterly entries automatically makes those categories available in the recategorization modal. No separate list to maintain.

### G. Adding a Data Migration

When you change the structure of existing persisted data (not just adding a new key):

1. **Increment** `DATA_VERSION` (search `const DATA_VERSION =`)
2. **Add** a migration function at the end of `DATA_MIGRATIONS` array
3. The function must:
   - Read raw localStorage with `localStorage.getItem()` + `safeJSONParse()`
   - Transform the data
   - Write back with `safeLocalStorageSet()`
   - Log to console: `console.log('[Migration] Running vN → vN+1')`
4. Be idempotent where possible (safe if run twice)
5. Never delete user data — only transform or add
6. Test with: (a) fresh install, (b) existing data at previous version, (c) export+import round-trip

---

## 15. Testing

### Existing Test Files

- `test-csv-parser-v2.js` — Tests CSV column detection and parsing across formats
- `test-tier-gating.js` — Tests Decision Pass, tier filtering, editability logic

Run with: `node test-csv-parser-v2.js` and `node test-tier-gating.js`

### Manual Testing Checklist

After any change, verify:

**Classification:**
- [ ] Import a CSV → check that known merchants (CVS, Starbucks, Delta) classify correctly
- [ ] Check a specific transaction's classification reason in the transactions table (hover/click category badge)
- [ ] Verify "Needs Review" filter shows only low-confidence transactions

**Points:**
- [ ] Pick a card with known multipliers → verify a dining transaction shows correct rate and reason
- [ ] Check a travel transaction → verify portal vs direct vs OTA classification
- [ ] If date-dependent: test transactions before and after the cutoff date

**Credits:**
- [ ] Verify auto-detected credits appear with correct names
- [ ] Verify manual credits show month checkboxes in card config
- [ ] Toggle a credit off → verify it's excluded from totals
- [ ] Check the summary credits dropdown shows correct breakdown

**Net Value:**
- [ ] Net Value = Points Value + Credits − Annual Fee (verify the math)
- [ ] Year filter: selecting a specific year shows only that year's data
- [ ] "All Years" shows combined totals with fees counted once per card

**Export/Import:**
- [ ] Export JSON → Clear all → Import JSON → verify data restored
- [ ] Export CSV → open in spreadsheet → verify columns and data

### Writing New Tests

For classification changes, the most valuable test is a simple assertion:
```javascript
// Test that CVS classifies as drugstore
const result = classifyMerchant('CVS PHARMACY #1234', 'Shopping', 'chase-sapphire-reserve');
assert(result.subcategory === 'drugstore', 'CVS should be drugstore');
assert(result.confidence === 100, 'CVS should be high confidence (known merchant)');
```

For points calculation:
```javascript
const mult = getMultiplier('chase-sapphire-reserve', 'dining', '2025-06-15');
assert(mult.rate === 3, 'CSR dining should be 3x');
```

---

## 16. Design Principles

These are non-negotiable and should guide every decision:

**Correctness over cleverness.** When unsure, default safely (usually 1x) and explain why in the reason string. Never silently guess.

**One source of truth for points logic.** `getMultiplier()` is the one function. All views must agree because they all call the same function.

**Auditability.** Every transaction carries a `reason` string explaining the multiplier decision and a `classificationReason` explaining the category decision. These are user-visible for trust and debugging.

**Transparency over automation.** Ask the user explicit questions rather than making assumptions. Surface limitations (low confidence, missing data) rather than hiding them.

**Minimize UI changes.** Do not redesign unless requested. Prioritize small, safe edits. When making a functional change, touch the minimum amount of rendering code necessary.

**The smallest safe change.** When fixing a bug or adding a feature, change as few lines as possible. Prefer surgical edits over wholesale rewrites.

**Privacy first.** No data leaves the browser. No network calls for core functionality. localStorage only. The sole exception is the Gumroad license verification call at Pro activation and at most once every 7 days for re-verification — no user data is sent, only the license key.

**Evidence-based choices.** Prefer shipping a working solution and gathering real user feedback over speculating about what users might want.

**SEO is not optional.** Every public-facing page must meet the standards in [Section 17](#17-seo--optimization-mandate). Every new insights article must follow [Playbook H](#18-playbook-h-publishing-a-new-insights-article). These are not post-launch tasks — they are part of "done."

---

## 17. SEO & Optimization Mandate

**Role & Directive:** When implementing any changes, new pages, or updates to creditcardvaluetracker.com, automatically apply all relevant optimizations from this section. Review these requirements for both new and existing pages. If you lack the necessary context to complete a check (e.g., missing author credentials for E-E-A-T, uncertain canonical URLs, or missing calculator variables), pause and ask before proceeding.

### Technical SEO & Architecture

**Sitemaps & Crawlability:** `sitemap.xml` must be segmented by content type (tools, articles) and include only canonical URLs returning a 200 status code. Keep `<lastmod>` dates accurate — Google, Bing, and AI crawlers treat them as freshness signals.

**Error Resolution:** Before shipping any change, check for 4xx errors and 3xx redirect chains. Crawlers must not hit dead ends. The existing `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` (covering `index.html`, `insights.html`, and individual insight articles) should be extended whenever new indexable pages are added. Run `grep -rEn 'href="(\.\.\/)?index\.html"' --include="*.html" .` and confirm it returns nothing — this is enforced automatically by the `SEO Lint` GitHub Actions workflow.

**Indexability:** Confirm that no core pages carry accidental `noindex` tags or have resources blocked in `robots.txt`. Maintain a logical category-to-subpage structure (e.g., `insights/` as parent, individual articles as children).

### Page-Level Meta Tags

Every public-facing page must have a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`. These are the single most important on-page SEO elements — they control how the page appears in search results and are the primary input for click-through rate.

**`<title>` tag rules:**
- 50–60 characters (Google truncates beyond ~60)
- Front-load the primary keyword or question the page answers
- End with the brand: `| Credit Card Value Tracker`
- No keyword stuffing — one core phrase per title
- Examples:
  - `index.html`: `Credit Card Value Tracker — Is Your Card Worth the Fee?`
  - Article: `Amex Gold vs. Chase Sapphire Preferred for Dining | Credit Card Value Tracker`
  - Calculator: `Annual Fee Calculator — Free Credit Card ROI Tool | Credit Card Value Tracker`

**`<meta name="description">` rules:**
- 140–155 characters (Google truncates beyond ~155)
- Write it as a compelling one-sentence summary that would make someone click
- Include the specific value proposition or scenario the page addresses
- Do not duplicate the title — expand on it
- Example: `Compare the Amex Gold and Chase Sapphire Preferred with real math. See exactly which card earns more on dining at your spending level.`

**Open Graph & Twitter Card tags:** Every public page must include `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type`, and `twitter:card`. Use the same title/description as the meta tags unless there's a reason to diverge (e.g., a shorter title for social display). The `og:image` should be a 1200×630px branded card or a relevant screenshot. If no image asset exists, ask before publishing.

**Canonical URLs:** Every page must include `<link rel="canonical" href="...">` pointing to itself (the canonical version). This prevents duplicate content issues if the same page is accessible at multiple URLs.

**Internal links must also use the canonical form of each URL** — the `<link rel="canonical">` tag is only a hint to Google; internal links that disagree with it send a conflicting signal and can suppress indexing. The most common mistake on this site: linking to `index.html` or `../index.html` when the canonical home page URL is `https://creditcardvaluetracker.com/`. On static hosts (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, etc.) both `/` and `/index.html` return HTTP 200 with no redirect, so Google can treat them as separate duplicate pages. **Always use `href="/"` for the home page in every nav link and body-text link. Never use `href="index.html"` or `href="../index.html"`.** The `SEO Lint` CI workflow enforces this automatically and will block any PR that reintroduces the pattern.

**The same rule applies to the `.html` extension on every other page.** Cloudflare Pages serves the extension-less URL as the real page and 308-redirects `/page.html` → `/page`. That means a `.html` URL is *always a redirect, never a final destination*. If canonical tags, `og:url`, JSON-LD `url` fields, the sitemap, or internal links point at `.html`, Google is told the canonical page is a URL that immediately redirects away — a self-contradiction that suppresses indexing. This was the root cause of the May 2026 indexing problems.

**Rule: every self-referential URL uses the extension-less form.** No `.html` in canonical tags, `og:url`/`twitter:url`, JSON-LD `url`/`@id`/`mainEntityOfPage`, `sitemap.xml` `<loc>` entries, or internal `href` links to our own pages. Examples:
- Canonical: `https://creditcardvaluetracker.com/insights/amex-gold-vs-chase-sapphire-preferred` (not `...preferred.html`)
- Internal link: `href="insights/amex-gold-vs-chase-sapphire-preferred"` (not `...preferred.html`)
- Sitemap `<loc>`: extension-less, matching the canonical exactly

The files on disk keep their `.html` names (that's how the host stores them); only the *URLs* drop the extension. Verify with: `grep -rno 'creditcardvaluetracker.com/[^"]*\.html"' --include="*.html" .` — should return nothing but the `your-post-slug.html` template placeholder.

### Schema Markup (Structured Data)

All structured data must be implemented as JSON-LD embedded in the `<head>`, not inline in the HTML body.

**Calculator pages** (`app.html`, `app-pro.html`, `demo.html`): wrap in `SoftwareApplication` schema. This signals the tool's utility to search engines and improves eligibility for rich snippet display.

**Content pages** (`insights/*.html`): use `Article` schema. Add `FAQ` schema wherever a page includes a question-and-answer section. Use `Review` schema if a page evaluates a specific card product. The `insights.html` index already uses `CollectionPage` JSON-LD — maintain that pattern.

**Silent Entity-Mapping Requirement for GEO:** To help AI Overviews and search engines associate our custom calculations with the correct entities, **always** map the `Article` schema to the specific `CreditCard` or `FinancialProduct` entities being discussed. Nest `CreditCard` schema objects within the `about` or `mentions` arrays of the parent `Article` schema. Declare exact `brand`, `amount` (annual fee), and issuer specs matching the corresponding card definition file.

### Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for 2026

AI search engines (Google SGE, Perplexity, etc.) favor structured, synthesizable content. Apply this format to all insight articles:

- **Query Headers:** H2s phrased as direct questions (e.g., "Is the Amex Gold worth it for dining?")
- **Key Takeaway Box:** A 2–3 sentence summary at the top of the article answering the question directly
- **Structured Proof:** A side-by-side calculation table showing the math
- **Contextual Deep-Dive:** 200–300 words of expert analysis below the table

**Bottom-of-Funnel focus:** Because AI zero-click results are compressing top-of-funnel traffic, articles must target specific, conversational, product-focused scenarios (e.g., "Amex Gold vs. Chase Sapphire Preferred for restaurant spend at $500/month") rather than broad informational queries.

**Entity building:** Optimize for named entities — the creditcardvaluetracker.com brand, specific card product names, and the site's proprietary calculation methodology (Net Value = points + credits − fee) — rather than generic keyword density. Consistent use of these entities across pages builds AI engine confidence and increases likelihood of "Primary Source" citations.

### Financial E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

Credit card content falls under Google's YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) guidelines and receives the highest level of scrutiny. Non-compliance risks ranking suppression regardless of technical quality.

**Author transparency:** Every insight article must include a visible author bio with specific hands-on financial experience stated (e.g., years of credit card optimization, cards actively held). If author credentials are not available, ask before publishing.

**Factual accuracy:** Calculation methodology, annual fees, and multiplier values in articles must match the values in the card definition files (`cards/*.js`). When card terms change and card definitions are updated, audit any article that references that card's numbers. This is not optional — factual drift is an E-E-A-T failure.

### Conversion Rate Optimization & User Flow

**Mobile-first UX:** Design all calculator inputs and interactive elements for touch screens first. Critical content (the net value result) must be visible without scrolling on a standard mobile viewport. Interactive buttons must be at least 44px tall.

**Navigation & CTAs:** Limit primary navigation to 5–7 items. Use high-contrast colors for primary CTA buttons (e.g., "Try the Calculator," "Upgrade to Pro") to draw the eye naturally. Do not add navigation items without removing or consolidating existing ones.

**Internal linking:** Build and maintain a logical link hierarchy. Insight articles should link to the calculator. The home page (`/`) should link to relevant articles. Related articles should cross-link. The goal is to keep users in the content ecosystem and guide them toward the primary conversion action (Pro upgrade or tool engagement). When adding a new article, identify at least two existing pages to link from and update them.

## 18. Playbook H: Publishing a New Insights Article

This is the end-to-end checklist for shipping a new article to `insights/`. Every step must be completed before the article is considered done. If any step requires information you don't have, stop and ask.

### Step 1: Content & Structure

- [ ] **Slug & file:** Create the file `insights/<slug>.html` using a URL-friendly slug (lowercase, hyphens, no dates in the URL). Keep the slug short and keyword-rich (e.g., `amex-gold-vs-sapphire-preferred-dining`). The *file* keeps its `.html` name; every *URL* that references it (canonical, og:url, sitemap, internal links) drops the extension — see Section 17 → Canonical URLs.
- [ ] **Article format follows GEO template** (see Section 17 → GEO):
  - H1: The article title (matches the `<title>` tag minus the brand suffix)
  - Key Takeaway Box: 2–3 sentence summary directly answering the article's core question, placed before any other content
  - H2s phrased as direct questions (query headers)
  - At least one side-by-side calculation table showing the math
  - 200–300 word contextual deep-dive per major section
- [ ] **Factual accuracy check:** All annual fees, multiplier values, credit amounts, and point valuations cited in the article match the values in the corresponding `cards/*.js` definition files. Do not proceed if they disagree — update the article or flag the discrepancy.
- [ ] **Author bio:** A visible author section with name and specific financial experience (e.g., "Chris has optimized credit card rewards for X years and currently holds [cards]"). If the bio text is not available, ask.

### Step 2: HTML `<head>` — Meta & SEO Tags

All of the following must be present and unique to this page:

- [ ] `<title>` — 50–60 characters, front-loaded keyword, ends with `| Credit Card Value Tracker` (see Section 17 → Page-Level Meta Tags for format)
- [ ] `<meta name="description">` — 140–155 characters, compelling one-sentence summary, does not duplicate the title
- [ ] `<link rel="canonical" href="https://creditcardvaluetracker.com/insights/<slug>">` (extension-less — **no** `.html`; this must match the sitemap `<loc>` exactly)
- [ ] **Open Graph tags:** `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (1200×630px), `og:url`, `og:type` (= `article`)
- [ ] **Twitter Card tags:** `twitter:card` (= `summary_large_image`), `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`
- [ ] **If no `og:image` asset exists**, ask before publishing — do not leave this blank or use a placeholder

### Step 3: Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Embed the following in the `<head>`, not inline in the body:

- [ ] `Article` schema with `headline`, `author`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `image`, `publisher`
- [ ] Map the article to specific credit card entities being analyzed by nesting `CreditCard` schemas inside the `about` or `mentions` array (declare correct `brand`, `amount` for annual fee, and issuer specs).
- [ ] `FAQ` schema if the article includes any question-and-answer sections
- [ ] `Review` schema if the article evaluates or recommends a specific card product
- [ ] Validate all JSON-LD with Google's Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) before shipping

### Step 4: Internal Linking

- [ ] **From the new article:** Link to the tracker (`app-pro.html`) or the home page (`/`) at least once, ideally with a contextual CTA (e.g., "Run the numbers on your own spending →"). Use `href="/"` for the home page — never `href="../index.html"`.
- [ ] **From the new article:** Link to at least one other related insights article
- [ ] **To the new article:** Identify at least two existing pages (other articles, `index.html`, `insights.html`) and add a link to the new article from each. Update those files.
- [ ] **Insights index:** Add the new article to `insights.html` with title, date, and a 1–2 sentence teaser. Follow the existing card/list pattern.

### Step 5: Sitemap & Crawlability

- [ ] Add the new URL to `sitemap.xml` with an accurate `<lastmod>` date
- [ ] Verify the new URL returns a 200 status code (not a redirect or error)
- [ ] Verify the page does not have a `noindex` tag
- [ ] Verify `robots.txt` does not block the new path

### Step 6: Mobile & UX Verification

- [ ] Page renders correctly on a 375px-wide viewport (iPhone SE size)
- [ ] All tables are horizontally scrollable or responsive — no layout-breaking overflow
- [ ] CTA buttons are at least 44px tall
- [ ] The Key Takeaway Box is visible without scrolling on mobile
- [ ] **CTA button text is white, not blue.** `.cta-btn` is an `<a>` element, so the browser's default link color (and `:visited`) can override the button's `color: #fff` and render the label blue. This is a recurring bug. The fix is to set the color on every link state, not just the base class:
  ```css
  .cta-btn, .cta-btn:link, .cta-btn:visited, .cta-btn:hover, .cta-btn:active { color: #fff; }
  ```
  Apply this in the new article's `<style>` block. Do **not** patch it per-article with a one-off `!important` override (that's how the inconsistency crept in across existing articles) — copy the multi-state `.cta-btn` rule verbatim from an already-fixed article so all Insights pages stay identical.

### Step 7: Final Review Checklist

Run through this after all other steps are complete:

- [ ] Title tag, meta description, and OG tags are unique (not copied from another page)
- [ ] JSON-LD validates without errors
- [ ] Umami Analytics tracking script injected right before the closing `</body>` tag (ID: `00612bf4-1142-4343-8b98-2339353027be`)
- [ ] All card-specific numbers match `cards/*.js` definitions
- [ ] At least two existing pages now link to this article
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` includes the new URL
- [ ] `insights.html` index includes the new article
- [ ] Author bio is present and specific
- [ ] No link in the new file or any updated file uses `href="index.html"` or `href="../index.html"` — home page links must be `href="/"`
- [ ] No canonical tag, `og:url`, JSON-LD `url`, sitemap `<loc>`, or internal link to our own pages contains `.html` — all self-referential URLs are extension-less (the live host redirects `.html` → clean, so `.html` URLs are always redirects)
- [ ] CTA button (`Try It Free`) renders with white text, not blue — verify the `.cta-btn` rule includes `:link`/`:visited`/`:hover`/`:active` states
- [ ] The `SEO Lint` GitHub Actions workflow passes (canonical links + sitemap audit)

If any box above cannot be checked, the article is not ready to ship.

## 19. Analytics & Event Tracking (Umami)

Analytics run on [Umami](https://umami.is) — privacy-friendly, no cookies, passive. Two distinct mechanisms, both documented here so a session adding a page or an interaction can stay consistent instead of grepping the codebase to find out what already exists.

### 19.1 The page-load script — every public page gets it

Every public-facing HTML page must include this exact snippet immediately before `</body>`:

```html
<!-- Umami Analytics -->
<script defer src="https://cloud.umami.is/script.js" data-website-id="00612bf4-1142-4343-8b98-2339353027be"></script>
```

This is not just for articles. New comparison pages, new tool pages, new landing pages — all of them. A page without this script is invisible to analytics, and nothing else will catch the omission. Currently present on all 10 pages: `index.html`, `app.html`, `app-pro.html`, `demo.html`, `compare.html`, `insights.html`, the comparison page(s), and each `insights/*.html`.

The `data-website-id` is the same on every page. Do not generate a new one per page.

### 19.2 Declarative event tracking — `data-umami-event` on links/buttons

For a click on a link or button, add a `data-umami-event="<Event Name>"` attribute to the element. No JS required — the Umami script picks it up.

**The naming convention is load-bearing.** Umami groups events by the exact string. `"Go to Tracker"` and `"Go To Tracker"` are two different events and fragment the data. Before coining a new name, check the inventory in 19.4 and reuse the existing string if the action is the same.

Canonical CTA strings currently in use:

| Event string | Used on |
|---|---|
| `Go to Tracker` | Every "Go to Tracker" / "Try it free" / "Launch Tracker" CTA that routes to `app-pro.html`, across all pages |
| `See a Demo` | The demo CTAs on `index.html` that route to `demo.html` |

**Rule:** any new CTA that routes to the tracker uses `data-umami-event="Go to Tracker"` — even if the visible button text differs ("Try it free", "Launch Tracker" all map to the same event). The event measures intent (going to the tracker), not button copy.

### 19.3 Programmatic event tracking — `umami.track()` in JS

For interactions that aren't a simple link click (a calculation completing, a file being processed), call `umami.track()` from JS. **Always guard it** so the app still works if the script is blocked:

```js
if (typeof umami !== 'undefined') umami.track('Event Name', { optionalProp: value });
```

The guard is mandatory. An unguarded call throws if an ad blocker drops the Umami script, which would break the surrounding handler.

### 19.4 Event inventory — the registry to extend

These are the only programmatic events that currently exist. When you add a new `umami.track()` call, **append it to this table in the same edit** (the same-response maintenance rule applies). When you add or remove a tracked event, this table is the source of truth a future session relies on to avoid duplicate names.

| Event name | Props | Fires when | Location (`app-core.js`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Card Scenario Calculated` | — | The Card Scenarios "Calculate" button is clicked | `cardscenariosCalculate` click handler (~L5864) |
| `View Tab` | `{ tab }` — one of `Summary`, `All Transactions`, `Card Scenarios`, `Credit Calendar` | A main tab is switched to, in `renderView()` | ~L6214 |
| `File Upload` | — | A CSV/JSON file is accepted in `handleFile()` | ~L8824 |
| `Export Data` | `{ format: 'CSV' }` | The Export CSV button is clicked | `exportCSV` click handler (~L9563) |
| `Export Data` | `{ format: 'JSON' }` | The Export JSON button is clicked | `exportJSON` click handler (~L9569) |

Line numbers are approximate — they drift as `app-core.js` changes. Grep for `umami.track` to find the current locations; the event names are the stable identifiers.

### 19.5 Where to put each kind of tracking

- **A new page** → add the 19.1 script snippet before `</body>`.
- **A new CTA link/button** → add `data-umami-event` (19.2), reusing an existing string from the table if the action matches.
- **A new non-click interaction worth measuring** → guarded `umami.track()` (19.3), and append the event to the 19.4 inventory in the same edit.
